My personal guitar songbook. Contains 333+ songs, primarily in Czech and English but also in other languages.

The songbook consists of two parts: 
- üëâÔ∏è the **[first part](https://github.com/kasnerz/songbook/raw/master/1.pdf)** is the original songbook compiled between 2020-22 (printed & slightly updated in the PDF version),
- üëâÔ∏è the **[second part](https://github.com/kasnerz/songbook/raw/master/2.pdf)** contains additional songs from 2023-24 (soon to be printed).

If you want to access the original printed version, have a look at the [v1 (2022) release](https://github.com/kasnerz/songbook/releases/tag/version-1).

The songbook is made with the [songs](http://songs.sourceforge.net) LaTeX package. 

The easiest way to build your own version of the songbook is using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/). Here is the [view-only version](https://www.overleaf.com/read/vhgxgnvpfyqv#86a034) of this songbook which you can copy and modify.

If you decide to build the songbook from source locally, make sure you have [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) installed.

Also, [here](https://github.com/kasnerz/chords2latex) is the script I am using for converting chords I find online to LaTeX.

Feel free to use any of the materials here for personal purposes :wink:
