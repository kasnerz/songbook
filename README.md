# Songbook

![cover](img/cover.png) ![index](img/index.png) ![index](img/page.png)

My personal guitar songbook. Made with the [songs](http://songs.sourceforge.net) LaTeX package. The songbook contains over 50 Czech songs and over 30 songs in English and other languages.

You can either download the **compiled [PDF](https://github.com/kasnerz/songbook/raw/master/songbook.pdf)** or 
build it by yourself from source.

*Note: right now, the songbook is work in progress. This means that I keep adding new songs and the songs may not be properly sorted.*

[Here](https://github.com/kasnerz/chords2latex) is the script I use for adding new songs without having to manually re-write them.
