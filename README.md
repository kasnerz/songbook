My personal guitar songbook. Contains 320 songs primarily in Czech and English but also in many other languages.

The songbook (üëâÔ∏è **[PDF](ttps://github.com/kasnerz/songbook/raw/master/songbook.pdf))** consists of two parts: 
- the first part exists as a printed version (compiled in July 2022),
- the second one is currently under preparation and exists online only.

In this branch, both parts are **merged in the single PDF**. If you want to access the original (printed) version, you can do it in the `part-1` branch (here is the link to the [PDF](https://github.com/kasnerz/songbook/raw/part-1/songbook.pdf)).



For building it by yourself from source, make sure you have TeX Live installed and then use the
`latexmk` command.

The songbook is made with the [songs](http://songs.sourceforge.net) LaTeX package. 

[Here](https://github.com/kasnerz/chords2latex) is the script I am using for converting chords to LaTeX.
