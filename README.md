My personal guitar songbook. Contains 320+ songs, primarily in Czech and English but also in other languages.

The songbook (üëâÔ∏è **[PDF](https://github.com/kasnerz/songbook/raw/master/songbook.pdf))** consists of two parts: 
- the first part exists as a printed version (compiled in July 2022),
- the second one is currently under preparation and exists online only.

In this branch, both parts are **merged in the single PDF**. If you want to access the printed version, have a look at the [v1 (2022) release](https://github.com/kasnerz/songbook/releases/tag/version-1).

The songbook is made with the [songs](http://songs.sourceforge.net) LaTeX package. 

If you want to build your version of the songbook, the easiest way to do it is using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/). Here is the [view-only version](https://www.overleaf.com/read/vhgxgnvpfyqv#86a034) of this songbook on Overleaf.

For building the songbook from source locally, first make sure you have [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) installed. Then you can use the `latexmk` command.


Also, [here](https://github.com/kasnerz/chords2latex) is the script I am using for converting chords I find online to LaTeX.


Feel free to use for personal purposes :wink:
