# Songbook

My personal guitar songbook. Made with :heart: using the [songs](http://songs.sourceforge.net) LaTeX package.

You can either download the **compiled [PDF](./songbook.pdf)** or 
build it by yourself from source. 

[Here](https://github.com/kasnerz/chords2latex) is the script I use for adding new songs without having to manually re-write them.

The songbook contains over 50 Czech songs and over 30 songs from other languages.
