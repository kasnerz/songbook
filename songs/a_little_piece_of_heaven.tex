\[D&]   Before the story begins,\[A/C#]     is it such a sin,
\[F&]   For me to take what's mine,\[G#&]    until the end of time?
\[D&]   We were more than friends,\[A/C#]     before the story ends,
\[F&]   And I will take what's mine, cre\[G#&]ate what God would never design
\endverse

\beginverse
\[D&]   Our love had been so \[A/C#]strong for far too long,
\[G#&]   I was weak with fear that \[D&]something would go wrong,
\[D&]   Before the possi\[A/C#]bilities came true,
\[G#&]   I took all possi\[D&]bility from you
\endverse

\beginverse
\[D&]Almost \[Dm/F]laughed my\[F&]self to \[G#dim7]tears,
\[D&]Conju\[Dm/F]ring her \[F&]deepest \[G#dim7]fears  \textit{(Come here ya' fuckin' bitch!)}
\endverse

\beginverse
\[D&]Must have stabbed her \[Dmmaj7/C#]fifty fucki\[Fm6]ng times,
I can't believe it,
\[D&]Ripped her heart out \[Dmmaj7/C#]right before h\[Fm6]er eyes,
Eyes over easy, \[G#dim7]eat it, eat it, eat it
\endverse

\beginverse
\[D&]   She was never this good in
\[D&]bed even when she was sleepin'
\[A/C#]     Now she's just so perfect I've
Ne\[A/C#]ver been quite so fucking deep in\[D&]\[B]\[D&]
It goes \[D&]on, and on, and \[A/C#]on, I can keep you
\[D&]lookin' young and pre\[D&]served forever,
With a \[D&]fountain to spray on your \[D&]youth when\[A/C#]ever

\beginchorus
'Cause I \[B]really always knew that my \[C]little crime
Would be c\[F]old that's why I got a heater \[D&]for your thighs
And I kn\[B]ow, I kn\[C]ow it's not your t\[F]ime
But bye, b\[D&]ye
And a \[B]word to the wise when the \[C]fire dies
You think it's \[A]over but it's just beg\[D&]un\[C]\[B]
But baby don't cr\[C]y
\[C]You had my h\[B]eart, at least for the mo\[C]st part
'Cause \[F]everybody's go\[C/E]tta die s\[D&]ometime, \[C]we fell ap\[B]art
Let's make a n\[C]ew start
'Cause \[F]everybody's g\[C/E]otta die s\[D&]ometime yea-y\[C]eah\[B]
But baby don't \[C]cry-ay-a\[C]y-ay-ay

\beginverse
\[D&]   New possibilities I'd \[A/C#]never considered,
\[G#&]    Are occurring the likes of \[D&]which I'd never heard,
\[D&]   Now an angry soul comes \[A/C#]back from beyond the grave,
\[G#&]   To repossess a body with \[D&]which I'd misbehaved
\endverse

\[D&]Smiling \[Dm/F]right from \[F&]ear to \[G#dim7]ear
\[D&]Almost \[Dm/F]laughed her\[F&]self to \[G#dim7]tears

\[D&]Must have stabbed him \[Dmmaj7/C#]fifty fuckin\[Fm6]g times,
I can't believe it,
\[D&]Ripped his heart out \[Dmmaj7/C#]right before hi\[Fm6]s eyes,
Eyes over easy, \[G#dim7]eat it, eat it, eat it

\beginverse
\[D&]   Now that it's done I
real\[D&]ize the error of my ways
I \[A/C#]must venture back to
apolog\[A/C#]ize from somewhere far beyond the \[D&]grave\[B]\[D&]
\endverse

\beginverse
\[D&]   I gotta make \[D&]up for what I've \[A/C#]done
