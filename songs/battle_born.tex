\beginverse
\[E]Once upon a time I swore I had a heart
\[G#&]Long before the world I know tore it all apart
\[E]Once upon a time there was a part of me I shared
\[G#&]Years before they took away the \[F#]part of me that cared
\endverse

\beginchorus
I've b\[E]een a thousand places
And sh\[F#]ook a million hands
I \[G#&]don't know where I'm going
But I \[F#]know just where I've been
I've fl\[E]own a million miles
And I've \[F#]rode so many more
\[G#&]Everyday a castaway
A \[F#]vagabond battle \[E]born
I'm battle \[G#&]born \[F#]â€¢
\endchorus

\beginverse
On\[E]ce upon a time I had an open point of view
\[G#&]But that was just so long ago before I had a clue
Wa\[E]s there such a time where I didn't stand alone
\[G#&]Was there ever a time and how wo\[F#]uld I have known
