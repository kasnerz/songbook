\beginverse
\[E]Sheets of empty \[Asus2]canvas, untouched \[E]sheets of clay\[Asus2]
Were \[E]laid spread out be\[A]fore me as her \[E]body once did
\endverse

\beginverse
\[E]All five hor\[Asus2]izons revolved \[E]around her soul \[Asus2]as the earth to the sun
\[E]Now the air I \[A]tasted and breathed has \[E]taken a turn
\endverse

\beginverse
\[C]Hmmmm, and all I taught her was every\[E&]thing
\[C]Hmmmm, I know she gave me all that \[E&]she wore
\endverse

\beginchorus
   And now my \[D]bitter hands,
Chafe \[C]beneath the clouds
Of what was \[E&]everything
All the \[D]pictures
Have all been \[C]washed in black
Tattooed everyt\[E&]hing
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[E]I take a \[Asus2]walk outside, I'm sur\[E]rounded by some \[Asus2]kids at play
\[E]I can feel their \[A]laughter so, \[E]why do I sear
\endverse

\beginverse
\[C]Hmmmm, and twisted thoughts that spin 'round my\[E&] head, I'm spinning, oh
I'm \[C]spinning, how quick the sun can drop a\[E&]way
\endverse

\beginchorus
   And now my \[D]bitter hands
Cradle \[C]broken glass
Of what was ever\[E&]ything 
All the \[D]pictures have
All been \[C]washed in black
Tattooed ever\[E&]ything
All the \[D]love gone bad
Turned my \[C]world to black
And tattooed all \[D]I see,
All that \[C]I am,
All I'll \[E&]be
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[D]  \[C]Yeah  \[E&]Uh huh  \[D]Uh huh  \[C]Uh
I \[E&]know someday you'll have a beautiful life,
I \[D]know you'll be a star in so\[C]mebody else's sky
But \[E&]why, why, \[D]why can't it \[C]be,
\[C]Why can't it be m\[E&]ine\[D]\[C]
\[E&]ooh, ah \[D]yeah, aah\[C] ooh
\[C](Doodoo-doo-doo-doodoodoo\[E&])
\[E&](Doodoo-doo-doo-doodoodoo\[D])
\[D]Doodoo-doo-doo-doodoodoo\[C]
\[C]Doodoo-doo-doo-doodoodoo\[E&]
