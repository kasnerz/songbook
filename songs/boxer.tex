\beginverse
\[A]I am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom \[F#&]told
I have \[E]squandered my resistance
For a \[D]pocketful of mumbles such are \[A]promises
All lies and \[F#&]jest still a \[E]man hears what he \[D]wants to hear
And disregards the \[A]rest\[E]\[D]\[E]\[A]
\endverse

\beginverse
When I \[A]left my home and family I was no more than a \[F#&]boy
In the \[E]company of strangers
In the \[D]quiet of a railway station \[A]running scared
Laying \[F#&]low seeking \[E]out the poorer \[D]quarters where the ragged people \[A]go
Looking \[E]for the places \[D]only \[E]they would \[A]know
\endverse

\beginchorus
   Lie-la-\[F#&]lie
Lie-la-\[C#&]la-la-la lie-la-lie
Lie la \[F#&]lie
Lie-la \[E]la la la la lie la la la la \[A]lie \[(F#&)]
\endchorus

\beginverse
Asking \[A]only workmans wages I come looking for a \[F#&]job
But I get no \[E]offers
Just a \[D]come-on from the whores on Seventh \[A]Avenue
I do de\[F#&]clare there were \[E]times when I was \[D]so lonesome I took some comfort \[A]there
La-la-\[E]la-la-la-la-la\[A]
\endverse

\refchorus

\beginverse
Then I'm \[A]laying out my winter clothes
And wishing I was \[F#&]gone
Going \[E]home where the \[E7]New York City winters aren't \[A]bleeding me
\[C#&] Leading me-\[F#&]e, going \[E]home\[A]
\endverse

\beginverse
In the \[A]clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his \[F#&]trade
And he \[E]carries the reminders
Of \[E]ev'ry glove that laid him down or \[A]cut him 'till he cried out
In his anger and his \[F#&]shame
"I am \[E]leaving, I am \[D]leaving."  But the fighter still re\[A]mains
Hm, hm, \[E]hm\[D]\[E]\[A]
