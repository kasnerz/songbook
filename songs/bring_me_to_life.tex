\beginsong{Bring Me To Life}[by={\normalsize Evanescence}]
\caponote[1]
\beginverse
\[E&]How can you see into my e\[A&]yes like open doors?
\[E&]Leading you down into my \[A&]core where I've become so numb
\[E&]Without a soul, \[A&]my spirit's sleeping somewhere \[E&]cold
Until you find it there and \[A&]lead it back home
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[E&]\textit{(Wake me up)} Wake me up in\[G]side
\textit{(I can't wake up)} Wake me up in\[D]side
\textit{(Save me)} Call my name and save me from the \[E&]dark
\textit{(Wake me up)} Bid my blood to \[G]run
\textit{(I can't wake up)} Before I come \[D]undone
\textit{(Save me)} Save me from the nothing I've be\[E&]come \[(C)]
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[E&]Now that I know what I'm \[C]without
You can't just leave me
Brea\[E&]the into me and make me \[C]real
Bring me to life
\endverse

\refchorus

\beginverse
\[C] Bring \[D]me to l\[E&]ife \textit{(I've been living a lie, there's nothing inside)}
\[C] Bring \[D]me to \[E&]life \[E&]\[D/F#]\[G]\[H&]
\endverse

\beginverse
\[A&]Frozen in\[Em/G]side without your \[D/F#]touch
Without your \[E&]love,  \[D/F#]darling
\[A&]Only \[G]you are the \[H]life among the dead
\endverse

\beginverse
\[E&]All this time I can't believe I couldn't see
\[E&]Kept in the dark but you were there in front of me
\[C/E]I've been sleeping a thousand years it seems
\[C/E]Got to open my eyes to everything
\[E&]Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul
\[E&]Don't let me die here
There must be some\[C]thing more
Bring \[D]me to l\[E&]ife
\endverse

\refchorus

\beginverse
\[C] Bring \[D]me to l\[E&]ife  \textit{(I've been living a lie, there's nothing inside)}
\[C]Bring \[D]me to \[E&]life
\endverse
