\beginsong{Clementine}[by={\normalsize Traditional}]
\beginverse
In a \[C]cavern, in a canyon,
excavating for a \[G7]mine;
dwelt a \[F]miner, forty-\[C]niner,
and his \[G7]daughter Clemen\[C]tine.
\endverse

\beginchorus
Oh my \[C]darling, oh my darling,
oh my darling Clemen\[G7]tine
Thou art \[F]lost and gone for\[C]ever,
dreadful \[G7]sorry, Clemen\[C]tine.
\endchorus

\beginverse
Light she \[C]was, and like a fairy,
And her shoes were number \[G7]nine,
Herring \[F]boxes without \[C]topses,
Sandals \[G7]were for Clemen\[C]tine.
\endverse

\refchorus

\beginverse
Drove she \[C]ducklings to the water
Ev'ry morning just at \[G7]nine,
Hit her \[F]foot against a \[C]splinter,
Fell in\[G7]to the foaming \[C]brine.
\endverse

\refchorus

\beginverse
Ruby \[C]lips above the water,
Blowing bubbles soft and \[G7]fine,
But a\[F]las, I was no \[C]swimmer,
So I \[G7]lost my Clemen\[C]tine.
\endverse

\refchorus

\beginverse
How I \[C]missed her, how I missed her,
How I missed my Clemen\[G7]tine,
'Til I \[F]kissed her little \[C]sister,
And for\[G7]got my Clemen\[C]tine.
\endverse

\refchorus
