\beginsong{Cockles and Mussels}[by={\normalsize Traditional}]
\beginverse
\[D]In Dublin's fair \[H&]city, where the \[E&]girls are so \[A]pretty
I \[D]first set my \[H&]eyes on sweet \[E&]Molly Ma\[A]lone
As she \[D]wheeled her wheel-\[H&]barrow
Through \[E&]streets broad and \[A]narrow
Crying \[D]cockles and \[H&]mussels, a\[A]live, alive-\[D]O!
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[D]Alive, alive\[H&]-O! a\[E&]live, alive-\[A]O!
Crying \[D]cockles and \[H&]mussels, a\[A]live, alive-\[D]O!
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[D]She was a fish-\[H&]monger, but \[E&]sure 'twas no \[A]wonder
For \[D]so were her \[H&]father and \[E&]mother be\[A]fore
And they \[D]each wheeled their \[H&]barrow
Through \[E&]streets broad and \[A]narrow
Crying \[D]cockles and \[H&]mussels, a\[A]live, alive-\[D]O!
\endverse

\refchorus

\beginverse
She \[D]died of a \[H&]fever, and \[E&]no one could \[A]save her
And \[D]that was the \[H&]end of sweet \[E&]Molly Ma\[A]lone
But her \[D]ghost wheels her \[H&]barrow
Through \[E&]streets broad and \[A]narrow
Crying \[D]cockles and \[H&]mussels, a\[A]live, alive-\[D]O!
