\beginverse
\[E&]On Wednesday the seventh \[C]your flight departed,
you wa\[A]ved us goodbye - we stood on the ground
as o\[E&]ne journey ended, a\[C]nother one started
you pa\[A]ssed overhead, your wings made no sound.
\endverse

\beginverse
This wo\[C]rld's just a rock - now a little bit lighter,
for \[E&]me there's a void where your smile once shone.
A n\[C]ew star is born far bigger and brighter
than \[D]all of the others - that's where you have gone.

\beginverse
\[E&]Over the stormclouds you fl\[C]oat high above me,
\[A]knelt in the dojo we offered a prayer.
\[E&]Yassi was smiling - you saw \[C]how she loves me,
I'm\[A] sure you look forward to meeting her there.
\endverse

\beginverse
\[C]One with the light that was sent here to guide you,
\[E&]forgotten the cripple asleep in her chair.
\[C]You dance hand in hand - Bernard standing beside you,
\[D]you're Ginger Rogers and he's Fred Astaire.

T\[A]his world's just a rock - now a little bit lighter,
a n\[C]ew star is born far big\[D]ger and brighter.
\[G]Constance in eternity,
\[D]Constance in eternity,
\[E&]\textit{Constance eternal, Constance eternal.}
