\endverse

\beginverse
\[C]Let us stay young\[G] or let us live forever\[A&]
We don't ha\[F]ve the power, but we never sa\[G]y never
Sitting in the \[D&]sandpit, life is a short\[F] trip
The music's for the \[Fmaj7]sad man\[G6]\[C]
\endverse

\beginverse
\[C]Can you imagine w\[G]hen this race is won\[A&]
Turn our go\[F]lden faces into the sun\[G]

Why don't they stay \[Fmaj7]young?\[G6]\[C]
\endverse

\beginverse
\[C]It's so hard to g\[G]et old without a cause\[A&]

And diamonds are fo\[Fmaj7]rever\[G6]\[C]
