\beginverse
\[A&]The books you think I \[F]wrote are way too \[C]thick\[G]
\[A&]Who needs a thousand \[F]metaphors to \[C]figure out you \[G]shouldn't be a \[A&]dick?
And I don't \[F]watch you when you sleep\[C]\[G]
\[A&]Surprisingly \[F]I don't use my \[C]omnipotence to \[E&]be a fucking \[F]creep
\endverse

\beginchorus
You're not \[A&]going to \[G]heaven\[F]
Why the fuck would you \[A&]think I'd ever \[G]kick it with you\[F]?
None of you are \[A&]going to \[G]heaven
\[F]There's a trillion \[A&]aliens \[G]cooler than you\[F]
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[A&]You shouldn't \[G]abstain from rape just \[A&]'cause you think that I\[G] want you \[F]to
\[A&]You shouldn't rape 'cause rape is a \[G]fucked up thing to do\[C]

Didn't think I had to write that one down for ya.)}

\[A&]I don't think \[F]masturbation is obscene\[C]\[G]
\[A&]It's absolutely \[F]natural and the \[C]weirdest fucking\[G] thing I've ever seen\[A&]
You make my \[F]job a living hell\[C]
\[G]I sent \[A&]gays to fix over\[F]population\[C]
And \[G]boy, did that go \[F]well
\endverse

\beginchorus
You're not \[A&]going to \[G]heaven\[F]
Eat a thousand \[A&]crackers, sing a \[G]million hymns\[F]
None of you are \[A&]going to \[G]heaven\[F]
You're not my \[A&]children, you're a \[G]bad game of Sims\[F]
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[A&]You shouldn't abstain from \[G]pork 'cause you \[A&]think that I \[G]want you to\[F]

\beginverse
\[A&]You argue and you \[F]bicker and you \[C]fight\[G]
\[A&]Atheists and \[F]Catholics, \[C]Jews and Hindus argue \[G]day and \[A&]night
Over \[F]what they think is \[C]true\[G]
\[A&]But no one \[F]entertains the \[C]thought that maybe God does not \[G]believe in you\[F]
\endverse

\beginchorus
You pray so \[A&]badly for \[G]heaven\[F]
knowing any day \[A&]may be the \[G]day that you \[F]die
But maybe life on \[A&]Earth could be \[G]heaven\[F]
Doesn't just the thought \[A&]of it make it \[G]worth a try?\[F]
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[C]My love's the type of \[F]thing that\[C] you have to earn\[G]
And when you \[C]earn i\[F]t you won'\[C]t need it\[G]
