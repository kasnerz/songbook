\beginsong{Hallelujah}[by={\normalsize Leonard Cohen}]
\beginverse
Now I've \[C]heard there was a se\[A&]cret chord
That \[C]David played, and it pl\[A&]eased the Lord
But \[F]you don't really \[G]care for music, do y\[C]ou?\[G]
It \[C]goes like this the \[F]fourth, the \[G]fifth
The \[A&]minor fall, the \[F]major lift
The \[G]baffled king com\[E7]posing Halle\[A&]lujah
Halle\[F]lujah, Halle\[A&]lujah, Halle\[F]lujah, Halle\[C]lu-\[G]u-\[C]jah\[G]
\endverse

\beginverse
Your \[C]faith was strong, but you \[A&]needed proof
You \[C]saw her bathing \[A&]on the roof
Her \[F]beauty and the \[G]moonlight over\[C]threw ya\[G]
She \[C]tied you to a \[F]kitchen \[G]chair
She \[A&]broke your throne, and she \[F]cut your hair
And \[G]from your lips she \[E7]drew the Halle\[A&]lujah
Halle\[F]lujah, Halle\[A&]lujah, Halle\[F]lujah, Halle\[C]lu-\[G]u-\[C]jah\[G]
\endverse

\beginverse
You \[C]say I took the \[A&]name in vain
\[C]I don't even \[A&]know the name
But \[F]if I did, well \[G]really, what's it \[C]to ya?\[G]
There's a \[C]blaze of light in \[F]every \[G]word
It \[A&]doesn't matter \[F]which you heard
The \[G]holy or the \[E7]broken Halle\[A&]lujah
Halle\[F]lujah, Halle\[A&]lujah, Halle\[F]lujah, Halle\[C]lu-\[G]u-\[C]jah\[G]
\endverse

\beginverse
I \[C]did my best, it \[A&]wasn't much
I \[C]couldn't feel, so I \[A&]tried to touch
I've \[F]told the truth, I \[G]didn't come to fool y\[C]a\[G]
And \[C]even though it \[F]all went \[G]wrong
I'll \[A&]stand before the \[F]Lord of Song
With \[G]nothing on my \[E7]tongue but Halle\[A&]lujah
\endverse

\beginverse
Halle\[F]lujah, Halle\[A&]lujah, Halle\[F]lujah, Halle\[C]lu\[G]jah \rep{2}\[C]
