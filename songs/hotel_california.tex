\beginverse
\[A&]  On a dark desert highway,\[E7] cool wind in my hair
\[G]  Warm smell of colitas\[D] rising up through the air
\[F]  Up ahead in the distance,\[C] I saw a shimmering light
\[D&]   My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
\[E7]  I had to stop for the night
\endverse

\beginverse
\[A&]  There she stood in the doorway;\[E7] I heard the mission bell
\[G]  And I was thinking to myself
This could be \[D]heaven or this could be hell
\[F]  Then she lit up a candle,\[C] and she showed me the way
\[D&]   There were voices down the corridor,
\[E7]  I thought I heard them say...
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[F]  Welcome to the Hotel Cali\[C]fornia.
Such a \[E7]lovely place, (such a lovely place), such a \[A&]lovely face
\[F]Plenty of room at the Hotel Cali\[C]fornia
Any \[D&]time of year, (any time of year) you can \[E7]find it here
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[A&] Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, \[E7]she got the Mercedes bends
\[G] She got a lot of pretty pretty boys \[D]  she calls friends
\[F]  How they danced in the courtyard, \[C]sweet summer sweat
\[D&]  Some dance to remember,\[E7] some dance to forget
\endverse

\beginverse
\[A&]  So I called up the captain;\[E7] please bring me my wine (he said)
\[G] We haven't had that spirit here since\[D] 1969
\[F]  and still those voices are calling from \[C]far away
\[D&]   Wake you up in the middle of the night
\[E7]  Just to hear them say...
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[F] Welcome to the Hotel Cali\[C]fornia.
Such a \[E7]lovely place, (such a lovely place), such a \[A&]lovely face
They're \[F]livin' it up at the Hotel Cali\[C]fornia
What a \[D&]nice surprise, (what a nice surprise) Bring your \[E7]alibis
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[A&]   Mirrors on the ceiling;\[E7] the pink champagne on ice (and she said)
\[G]  We are all just prisoners here,\[D] of our own device
\[F]  and in the master's chambers,\[C] they gathered for the feast
\[D&] They stab it with their steely knives but they
\[E7]just can't kill the beast
\endverse

\beginverse
\[A&]   Last thing I remember, I was\[E7] running for the door
\[G]  I had to find the passage back to the \[D]place I was before
\[F]  "Relax" said the night man; we are\[C] programmed to receive
\[D&]  You can check out any time you like
\[E7] But you can never leave...
