\caponote[1]
\beginverse
I have \[C]climbed highest mountains
I have run through the fields
only to \[Fsus2]be with you, only to \[C]be with you
I have \[C]run, I have crawled
I have scaled these city walls, these city \[Fsus2]walls
only to \[C]be with you
\endverse

\beginchorus
But I \[G]still haven't \[Fsus2]found what I'm \[C]looking for
But I \[G]still haven't \[Fsus2]found what I'm \[C]looking for
\endchorus

\beginverse
I have \[C]kissed honey lips
Felt the healing in her fingertips
It burned like \[Fsus2]fire, this burning de\[C]sire
I have \[C]spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of the devil
It was warm in the \[Fsus2]night, I was cold as a \[C]stone
\endverse

\beginverse
I be\[C]lieve in the kingdom come
then all the colours they will
bleed into one, bleed into \[Fsus2]one
But yes I'm still \[C]running
You broke the \[C]bonds and you loosed the chains
carried the cross of, of my shame, of my \[Fsus2]shame
You know I be\[C]lieve it
