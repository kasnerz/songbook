\[E&]Dead Love couldn't go no further,
\[E&]Proud of and disgusted by her,
\[E&]Push shove, a little bruised and battered,
\[D]Oh Lord I ain't \[H7]comin' home with \[E&]you

\beginverse
\[E&]My lifes a bit more colder,
\[E&]Dead wife is what I told her,
\[E&]Brass knife sinks into my shoulder,
\[D]Oh babe don't know \[H7]what I'm gonna \[E&]do
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[E&]I see my red head, messed bed, tear shed, queen bee, my squeeze.
The stage it smells, tells, hells bells, mis-spells, knocks me on my \[D]knees
It didn't \[E&]hurt, flirt, blood squirt, stuffed shirt, hang me on a \[A&]tree
After I \[E&]count down, three rounds, in \[H7]Hell I'll be in good comp\[E&]any \rrep
