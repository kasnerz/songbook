\beginsong{In My Life}[by={\normalsize The Rasmus}]
\beginverse
\[E]Feel the heat below my feet
\[A&]I have to go, no time to sleep
\[E]Can't believe the things you say
I \[A&]turn my head and walk away
You \[D&]make me sick, you \[E/G#]make me n\[A&]ervous
\[E]Times are gone when you would say
\[A&]This is the one and seize the day
\[E]Times are gone for honesty
\[A&]"My victory is your defeat"
\[D&]Oh can't you see you've b\[E]een mist\[A&]aken\[G]
\endverse

\beginchorus
In my \[C]life I \[E]decide and it \[A&]turns me \[D&]on
How I \[Fmaj7]am,   how I l\[E]ive, who I l\[A&]ove,  ye\[G]ah
In my \[C]way I feel st\[E]rong and it t\[A&]urns me o\[D&]n
In my \[Fmaj7]life,  I dec\[E]ide, I dec\[A&]ide,         I decide
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[E]All you do, you can't deny it,
\[A&]It's waste of time, waste of time
\[E]Can I suggest that you invest
\[A&]In something more than hopelessness
Be\[D&]fore you know, the r\[E/G#]ide is \[A&]over \[G]

It's up to you if you give it up, give it up,
It's up to you, it's up to you!

\[A&]   The record \[G]shows that you're \[F]dead but you're \[G]still living
