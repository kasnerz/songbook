\[A&] \[G] \rep{4}
\endverse


\beginverse
It starts with \[A&]one thing I don't know why
It \[G6]doesn't even matter how hard you try
\[F]Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To \[G]explain in due time
\endverse

\beginverse
All I kno\[A&]w, time is a valuable thing
\[G6]Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
\[F]Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock\[G] ticks life away
\endverse

\beginverse
It's so un\[A&]real, didn't look out below
\[G6]Watch the time go right out the window
\[F]Trying to hold on, but didn't even know
Or \[G]wasted it all just to
\endverse

\beginverse
Watch you \[A&]go, I kept everything inside
And \[G6]even though I tried, it all fell apart
\[F]What it meant to me will eventually be
A m\[G]emory of a time when
\endverse

\beginchorus
I tried so \[A&]hard and got so \[C]far
But in the \[G]end it doesn't even \[F]matter
I had to \[A&]fall to lose it \[C]all
But in the \[G]end it doesn't even \[F]matter
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[A&]One thing, I don't know why
It \[G6]doesn't even matter how hard you try
\[F]Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To \[G]remind myself how
\endverse

\beginverse
I tried so \[A&]hard, in spite of the way you were mocking \[G6]me
Acting like I was part of your proper\[F]ty
Remembering all the times you fought with \[G]me
\endverse

\beginverse
I'm surprised it got so \[A&]far
Things aren't the way they were befor\[G6]e
You wouldn't even recognize me anymor\[F]e
Not that you knew me back then but \[G]it all comes back to me
\endverse

\beginverse
In the \[A&]end you kept everything inside
And even \[G6]though I tried, it all fell apart
\[F]What it meant to me will eventually be
A memor\[G]y of a time when
\endverse

\refchorus

\beginverse
I've put my \[A&]trust in \[G]you
Pushed as \[F]far as I can\[G] go
And for all t\[A&]his
There's only \[G6]one thing you should \[F]know\[G]
\endverse
