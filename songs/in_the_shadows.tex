No s\[H&]leep, \[F#&]  no sleep until I'm \[H&]done with finding the a\[F#&]nswer
Won't s\[H&]top, \[F#&]  won't stop before I \[H&]find a cure for this ca\[F#&]ncer
\[D]Sometimes,\[F#&]  I feel like going \[H&]down, I'm so disconne\[F#&]cted
\[D]Somehow,\[F#&]  I know that I am \[H&]haunted to be wa\[F#&]nted
\endverse

\beginchorus
I've been wa\[D]tching, I've been wai\[F#&]ting
In the sha\[H&]dows for my t\[F#&]ime
I've been sear\[D]ching, I've been li\[F#&]ving
For tomor\[H&]rows, all my \[F#&]life
\endchorus

They \[H&]say \[F#&]  that I must learn to \[H&]kill before I can fe\[F#&]el safe
But I\[H&],   \[F#&]  I'd rather kill my\[H&]self than turn into thei\[F#&]r slave
\[D]Sometimes,\[F#&]  I feel that I should \[H&]go and play with the thu\[F#&]nder
\[D]Somehow,\[F#&]  I just don't wanna \[H&]stay and wait for a wo\[F#&]nder
\endverse

\beginverse
\[D]Lately, I've been walking, \[E]walking
In \[F#&]circles, watching, waiting for \[A]something
\[H&]Feel me, touch me, heal me, \[A]come, take me \[F#&]higher\[F#&]\[F&]\[E&]

Ohoh Oh\[D]oh, Ohoh Oh\[F#&]oh, In the sha\[H&]dows\[F#&]
Ohoh Oh\[D]oh, Ohoh Oh\[F#&]oh, In the sha\[H&]dows\[F#&]
I've been wai\[D]ting
