\beginsong{Land of a Thousand Hills}[by={\normalsize Ian D'sa \& Noble Blood}]
\beginverse
For \[A&]love and for country, its \[D&]never the same
To \[C]men of high power, the \[E]two dont equate
When \[A&]leaders of nations, and \[D&]brokers of hate
Con\[C]tinue to play the most \[E]deadly of \[A&]games\[A&]
\endverse

\beginverse
They \[A&]shuffle their demons, and \[D&]deal out their sins
\[C]Hand out their weapons, like \[E]candy to kids
\[A&]Pull on their people, like \[D&]puppets on strings
To \[C]play out their war, in the \[E]court of the \[A&]king\[A&]
\endverse

\beginchorus
   And the \[C]fires keep burning in the \[G]middle of the night
The \[A&]rivers keep flowing like the \[F]tears from your eyes
You can \[C]still hear the voices of \[G]all those who died
In the \[F]land of a \[D&]thousand \[A&]hills
\endchorus

\beginverse
We \[A&]drank through the summer, and \[D&]soaked in the sun
While \[C]over the ocean, the \[E]killing begun
They \[A&]followed their leaders, and \[D&]fired their guns
We \[C]had no idea, of \[E]what was to \[A&]come\[A&]
\endverse

\beginchorus
   And the \[C]fires keep burning in the \[G]middle of the night
The \[A&]rivers keep flowing like the \[F]tears from your eyes
You can \[C]still hear the voices of \[G]all those who died
They \[A&]echo, they echo, like \[F]shots from a gun
They \[A&]echo, they echo, like the \[F]rhythm of your drum
For \[A&]one hundred days, you could \[G]never see the sun
In the \[F]land of a \[D&]thousand hi\[A&]lls
\endchorus

\beginverse
And \[A&]years will have passed, 'til the \[D&]world would find out
The \[C]truth of unthinkable \[E]violence, so loud
It \[A&]shattered the heavens, and \[D&]silenced the crowd
The \[C]highest almighty, can\[E]not save us now
Oh my \[A&]brother, oh my brother, tell me \[D&]what have you done?!
We'll \[C]hide in the church, til the bul\[E]ldozers come
There are \[A&]men with machetes, and \[D&]children with guns
We'll \[C]never forgive you, for \[E]what you have \[A&]done
\endverse

\beginchorus
   And the \[C]fires keep burning in the \[G]middle of the night
The \[A&]rivers keep flowing like the \[F]tears from your eyes
You can \[C]still hear the voices of \[G]all those who died
They \[A&]echo, they echo, like \[F]shots from a gun
They \[A&]echo, they echo, like the \[F]rhythm of your drum
The \[A&]rest of the world will \[F]expose all their lies
And \[A&]all those you silenced will \[F]once again rise
For \[A&]one hundred days, you could \[G]never see the sky
In the \[F]land of a \[D&]thousand \[A&]hills
For \[A&]one hundred days, you could \[G]never see the sky
In the \[F]land of a \[D&]thousand \[A&]hills \rep{2}
\endchorus
