\[E&]I know what it takes to break you
\[E&]You know I never sleep
\[F#&]Just because you made them think
\[E]Doesn't mean the world will fall into place
\endverse

\beginverse
\[E&]Took some time but now you know
\[E&]Tomorrow is too late
\[F#&]Close your eyes, walk with \[E]me, I set you free
\[D]And everything you \[E]ask for
\endverse

\beginchorus
I found a \[A]way and I'll return here \[F#&]soon \[E]
I have to \[D]see those who do not know
\[E]Rest in peace, I'm coming for \[D]you
And \[E]I will \[F#&]be, \[D]I will be with \[E]you tonight
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[E&]If today was your last day, would that change a thing?
\[F#&]You probably believe what you told them
\[E]Leave each moment like your last
\[F#&]Close your eyes, walk with m\[E]e, I set you free
\[D]And everything you \[E]ask for
