\beginverse
Oh, \[A&]life is bigger\[E&]
It's bigger than you
And you are \[A&]not me.
The lengths that I will \[E&]go to,
The distance in your \[A&]eyes,\[E&]
Oh no, I've said too \[D&]much,
I set it \[G]up.
\endverse

\beginverse
That's me in the \[A&]corner,
That's me in the \[E&]spotlight
Losing my re\[A&]ligion.
Trying to \[E&]keep up with you.
And I \[A&]don't know if I can do it.\[E&]
Oh no, I've said too \[D&]much,
I haven't said e\[G]nough.
\endverse

\beginchorus
   I \[G]thought that I heard you \[F]laughing,
I \[D&]thought that I \[G]heard you \[A&]sing.\[Am/B]\[Am/C]\[Am/D]
\[A&]I  th\[F]ink I thought I \[D&]saw  \[G]you \[A&]try.\[G]
\endchorus

\beginverse
Every whis\[A&]per of every waking h\[E&]our
I'm choosing my con\[A&]fessions,
Trying to \[E&]keep an eye on you
Like a \[A&]hurt lost and blinded fool, fool\[E&]
Oh no, I've said too \[D&]much,
I set it \[G]up.
\endverse

\beginverse
Consider \[A&]this, consider this,
The \[E&]hint of a century,
Consider \[A&]this: the slip
That \[E&]brought me to my knees failed.
\[A&]What if all these fantasies
Come \[E&]   flailing around?
Now I've \[D&]said too \[G]much.
\endverse

\refchorus

\beginverse
But \[C]that was just a \[D&]dream,
\[C]That was just a \[D&]dream.
\endverse

\beginverse
That's me in the \[A&]corner,
That's me in the \[E&]spotlight
Losing my re\[A&]ligion.
Trying to \[E&]keep up with you.
And I \[A&]don't know if I can do it.\[E&]
Oh no, I've said too \[D&]much,
I haven't said e\[G]nough.

\beginverse
I th\[G]ought that I heard you la\[F]ughing,
I \[D&]thought that I \[G]heard you \[A&]sing.\[Am/B]\[Am/C]\[Am/D]
\[A&]I  \[F]think I thought I s\[D&]aw y\[G]ou t\[A&]ry.\[Am/B]\[Am/C]\[Am/D]\[A&]
But \[F]that was just a \[D&]dream\[G],
\[A&]Try, \[Am/B]cry,   \[Am/C]why,   \[Am/D]try.\[A&]
\[F]That was just a dream, \[D&]   j\[G]ust a d\[A&]ream, just a d\[G]ream, dream.
