\beginverse
\[E&]   All around me are fa\[G]miliar faces
\[D]Worn out places, \[A]worn out faces
\[E&]   Bright and early for their \[G]daily races
\[D]Going nowhere, \[A]going nowhere
\[E&]   Their tears are filling \[G]up their glasses
\[D]No expression, \[A]no expression
\[E&]   Hide my head, I want to \[G]drown my sorrow
\[D]No tomorrow, \[A]no tomorrow
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[E&]   And I find it kinda \[A]funny, I find it kinda \[E&]sad
The dreams in which I'm \[A]dying are the best I've ever \[E&]had
I find it hard to \[A]tell you, I find it hard to \[E&]take
When people run in \[A]circles, it's a very, very
\[E&]   Mad w\[A]orld
\[E&]   Mad w\[A]orld
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[E&]   Children waiting for the \[G]day they feel good
\[D]Happy birthday, \[A]happy birthday
\[E&]   And I feel the way that \[G]every child should
\[D]Sit and listen, \[A]sit and listen
\[E&]   Went to school, and I was \[G]very nervous
\[D]No one knew me, \[A]no one knew me
\[E&]   Hello, teacher, tell me \[G]what's my lesson
\[D]Look right through me, \[A]look right through me
