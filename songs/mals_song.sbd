\beginverse
\[D]When the stars shine bright through the en\[C]gine's trail
And the d\[F]ust of a\[A&]nother world drops be\[D&]hind
When my ship is f\[F]ree of the o\[C]pen sky
It's a \[F]damn good \[A&]day to my way of \[D&]mind
There's a \[D]barren planet you \[C]never can leave
There's a \[F]rocky \[A&]valley where we lost a \[D&]war
There's a \[F]cross once hung 'round a \[A&]soldier's neck
There's a \[F]man's faith \[A&]died on Serenity's \[D&]floor
But I \[F]stood my ground and I'll \[A&]fly once \[D&]more
It's the \[F]last oath that I \[A&]ever \[D&]swore
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[D]Take my love, \[C]take my land,
\[G]take me where I \[D]cannot \[A]stand
\[F]I don't care, \[C]I'm still free
\[G]You can't take the \[D]sky from \[A]me
\[D]Take me out in\[C]to the black, 
\[G]tell 'em I ain't c\[D]omin' \[A]back
\[F]Burn the land and \[C]boil the sea
\[G]You can't take the \[D]sky from \[A]me
\[F]You can't take the \[C]sky from \[D]me
\endchorus

\beginverse
When you \[D]see a man and he's s\[C]tandin' alone
Well you \[F]might just \[A&]take him for an easy \[D&]mark
And there's \[F]many a man has \[C]tried his hand
And there's \[F]worse than \[A&]wolves in the borderland \[D&]dark
From the \[D]savage men to the \[C]government hounds
Try to \[F]take what's \[A&]yours and tear you \[D&]through
Ah but \[F]them that run with me's \[C]got my back
It's a \[F]fool don't \[A&]know that his family's his \[D&]crew
Don't you \[F]tell me \[A&]what I cannot \[D&]do
Don't you \[F]think I've got to \[A&]run from \[D&]you
\endverse

\refchorus

\beginverse
When you've \[D]walked my road and you've \[C]seen what I've seen
Well you \[F]won't go \[A&]talkin' 'bout righteous \[D&]men
You'll know \[F]damn well why I want to \[C]keep to my sky
Never \[F]cry 'neath \[A&]nobody's heel a\[D&]gain
I've seen \[D]torment raked across \[C]innocent souls
Seen \[F]sane men \[A&]mad and good men \[D&]die
I've been \[F]hounded, hated, \[C]married and tricked
I've been \[F]tortured, cheated, \[A&]shot and \[D&]tied
You won't \[F]see no tears when I \[A&]say good\[D&]bye
I've still \[F]got my family and my \[A&]Fire\[D&]fly
