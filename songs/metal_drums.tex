\beginverse
From the \[A&]time he was a \[F]kid
Mark O'\[G]Donnell and his buddies would
\[A&] Play in the \[F]pasture out behind his \[G]neighborhood
There were \[A&]acres of vacant \[F]land
And they \[G]played as only children can
\[A&]Ooh,\[F]  in the \[G]pasture
\endverse

\beginverse
\[A&]Out in the long tall \[F]grass
Metal \[G]drums were lying in the broken glass
\[A&]The kids would \[F]play with the stuff in\[G]side them
They'd crawl \[A&]in and roll a\[F]round
End up \[G]spinning around on the summer ground
\[A&]Ooh,\[F] of the p\[G]asture
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[A&]Ooh,\[F]   \[G]  they were playing with the metal drums
\[A&]Ah, \[F]   \[G]  banging on the metal drums now
\[A&]Ooh,\[F]   \[G]  beat that metal drum a little \[A&]fast\[F]er\[G]
\endchorus

\beginverse
In the \[A&]town of Holbrook, \[F]Mass
You're \[G]lucky if you got the chance
\[A&]Working a \[F]good job, making a \[G]few bucks
And it's \[A&]Baird and Mc\[F]Clair
They \[G]run that chemical plant down there
\[A&]Ooh,\[F] by the p\[G]asture
\endverse

\refchorus

\beginverse
Joanne O\[A&]'Donnell had \[F]five kids
And \[G]all but one of her kids got sick
\[A&]She was \[F]hard pressed for \[G]answers
\endverse
\beginverse
And on the \[A&]other side of \[F]town
There was a \[G]street where all the doctors found
\[A&]Every other \[F]woman died of \[G]cancer
\endverse

\beginverse
\[D]News broke like a lightning bolt a\[F]cross a red-hot \[G]sky
\[E&]In the blue TV light J\[D]oanne O'Donnell cried
\[D]Seemed like the kiss of death \[F]hung in the air\[G]
When a \[E&]whole town f\[G]ound out they'd been \[D]poisoned for years

\endverse

\beginverse
The en\[A&]vironmental \[F]plan
Put the \[G]site on the list of the big top ten
\[A&]To the tune of \[F]sixty-three \[G]million
\[A&]Thanks to the women and the \[F]wives
There's a\[G] chain link fence up eight feet high
\[A&]But that won't \[F]bring back their \[G]children
\endverse

\beginverse
And as for \[A&]Baird and Mc\[F]Clair
All the \[G]soil from the ground to the bedrock down \[A&]there
Was \[F]ruined by the \[G]bastards
\[A&]Thanks to the corporate \[F]mind
They pro\[G]tected their assets - they're doing fine
\[A&]  Too bad about the \[F]Holbrook di\[G]saster
\endverse

\refchorus

\beginverse
Beat that metal drum a little \[A&]faster now\[F]\[G]
Beat that metal \[A&]drum\[F]...\[G]
