\[A&] Have you \[F]ever thought that \[C]all of the \[D]things you be\[A&]lieve

They took you \[F]by the hand and \[C]led you just \[D]like you were \[C]blind \[G]

\[F]Far from our daily \[G]chaos

Her passion for \[A&]life and for what's \[G]true
what's truly right in the heart
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[A&]Dig in you passions and \[C]follow you heart
Miss Con\[F]ception awaits your ar\[G]rival tonight

When you \[F]feel like a man even \[G]just for a, just for a \[A&]while \[F]\[G]

^ Don't be ^shy or stupid, ^wake up and ^follow her ^trail
You have been ^walking the ^wrong one like ^a drunken ^snail
This is the ^time to end this ^parody of ^life and set ^sail ^

^ The trees are ^covered up with ^vines, look they're ^running in^sane
The crows high ^in the sky and ^the air filled ^with smell of ^rain
This place seems ^horrible but ^please don't pro^ceed with dis^dain ^

\beginverse
\[A&]Oh here she comes, \[F]dressed with air and \[E]sunshine
\[A&]Stroking her \[C]white legs, \[D]sexed and \[D&]shivering
\[A&]And there they are, the \[F]riot of \[E]pure ones
\[A&]Feasting on \[F]her promiscuous \[E]banquet
\endverse

\beginverse
\[A&]Oh here she comes, \[F]I can see her \[E]face now
\[A&]And our tongues, \[C]our hands \[D]dancing in the \[D&]moonlight
How \[A&]far will she go?
\[F]I can hear her \[E]soft voice \[A&]whispering \[C]everlasting words of \[F]lust \[A&] \[G]

Even just for... \[F]
Even just for a \[G]while \[A&]
\[F]In the dead of night, Miss Conception \[A&]comes
