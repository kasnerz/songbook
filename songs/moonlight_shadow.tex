\beginverse
The \[A&]last that ever she \[F]saw him
C\[G]arried away by a mo\[C]onlight shad\[G]ow
He \[A&]passed on worried and \[F]warning
C\[G]arried away by a m\[C]oonlight sh\[G]adow.
L\[C]ost in a river last s\[G]aturday night
F\[A&]ar aw\[F]ay on the o\[G]ther side.
He was c\[C]aught in the middle of a de\[G]sperate fight
And she c\[A&]ouldn't find \[F]how to push t\[G]hrough
\endverse

\beginverse
The \[A&]trees that whisper in the \[F]evening
\[G]Carried away by a mo\[C]onlight sh\[G]adow
Si\[A&]ng a song of sorrow and \[F]grieving
\[G]Carried away by a \[C]moonlight \[G]shadow
A\[C]ll she saw was a silhouet\[G]te of a gun
\[A&]Far aw\[F]ay on the ot\[G]her side.
He was s\[C]hot six times by a man\[G] on the run
And she \[A&]couldn't find \[F]how to push \[G]through
\endverse

I see y\[C]ou in h\[F]eaven \[G]one day
\endchorus

\beginverse
4\[A&] AM in the m\[F]orning
\[G]Carried away by a \[C]moonlight sh\[G]adow
I w\[A&]atched your vision \[F]forming
\[G]Carried away by a mo\[C]onlight sh\[G]adow
St\[C]ar was light in a silv\[G]ery night
\[A&]Far \[F]away on the \[G]other side
Will yo\[C]u come to talk to me \[G]this night
But she \[A&]couldn't find \[F]how to push \[G]through
\endverse

\refchorus

\beginverse
C\[C]aught in the middle of a h\[G]undred and five  \[A&] \[F] \[G]
The n\[C]ight was heavy but the \[G]air was alive
But she co\[A&]uldn't find h\[F]ow to push t\[G]hrough\ldots
