\beginverse
\[C]  I'm coming out of my \[C/H]cage
And I've been doing just f\[F]ine
Gotta gotta be down
Because I want it all
\[C]  It started out with a \[C/H]kiss
How did it end up like th\[F]is?
It was only a kiss
It was only a kiss
\[C]  Now I'm falling a\[C/H]sleep
And she's calling a c\[F]ab
While he's having a smoke
And she's taking the drag
\[C]  Now they're going to \[C/H]bed
And my stomach is s\[F]ick
And it's all in my head
But she's touching his
\endverse

\beginverse
\[A&]Chest now
He takes off her dr\[G]ess now
Let me \[F]go
\[A&]  'Cause I just can't look
It's k\[G]illing me
And t\[F]aking control
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[C]Jealousy
\[F]Turning saints \[A&]into the sea
\[G]Swimming through sick l\[C]ullabies
\[F]Choking on your a\[A&]libies
\[G]But it's just the p\[C]rice I pay
\[F]Destiny is \[A&]calling me
\[G]Open up my e\[C]ager e\[Fmaj7]yes
\[A&]   'Cause I'm Mr. B\[G]rightside
