\beginverse
\[E&]  I'm tired of being what you \[C]want me to be
\[G]Feeling so faithless lost \[D]under the surface
\[E&]  Don't know what you're ex\[C]pecting of me
Put \[G]under the pressure of \[D]walking in your sh\[C]oes
\textit{(Caught in the undertow, just \[D]caught in the undertow)}
Every \[E&]step I take is an\[G]other mistake to \[C]you
\textit{(Caught in the undertow, just \[D]caught in the undertow)}
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[E&]I've become so \[C]numb, I can't feel you \[G]there
I've become so \[D]tired, so much more a\[E&]ware
I'm becoming \[C]this, all I want to \[G]do
Is be more like \[D]me and be less like \[E&]you
\endchorus

\beginverse
Can't you see that you're \[C]smothering me
\[G]Holding too tightly a\[D]fraid to lose contr\[E&]ol
Cause everything that you tho\[C]ught I would be
Has \[G]fallen apart r\[D]ight in front of \[C]you
\textit{(Caught in the undertow, just \[D]caught in the undertow)}
Every \[E&]step that I take is an\[G]other mistake to \[C]you
\textit{(Caught in the undertow, just \[D]caught in the undertow)}
And every \[E&]second I waste is more than \[G]I can ta\[D]ke
\endverse

\beginverse
And I \[D]know
I may \[E&]end \[D/F#]up   \[G]fail\[Hm7]ing \[C]too
But I kn\[D]ow
You were \[H]just like me with someone \[Hsus4]disappointed in you

\[E&]I've become so \[C]numb, I can't feel you \[G]there
I've become so \[D]tired, so much more a\[E&]ware
I'm becoming \[C]this, all I want to \[G]do
Is be more like \[D]me and be less like \[E&]you
I've become so \[C]numb, I can't feel you \[G]there
\textit{(Tired of being what you w\[D]ant me to be)}
\[E&]I've become so \[C]numb, I can't feel you \[G]there
