\beginsong{Rancorous Heart}[by={\normalsize Toehider}]
\beginverse
\[A&]Mine is a mind that is \[E&]tired all the \[F]time
It gets \[G]harder to \[C]find a good \[C/E]time to un\[F]wind
\[D&]Back to \[F]work, I \[G]guess that's \[E&]fine..?
\endverse

\beginverse
\[A&]Try to stay focused, \[E&]put my head \[F]down
We \[G]can't all be \[C]kings, we can't \[C/E]all fit the \[F]crown
\[D&]Flood that \[F]silence \[G]out with s\[E&]ounds
For a \[A&]moment I'm grateful, \[E&]haughty and \[F]proud
\endverse

\beginchorus
And \[A7sus4]then I'll see someone that's \[E7]similar to \[H&]me
But \[A]fitter and more nicely \[A7sus4]lit
\[E]Instantly floods up the \[F#&]blood spitting spite
And I \[D9]feel my self worth shot to shit
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[A&]Admit it's a sin, else \[E&]it's hard to r\[F]epent
You \[G]can't rape the \[C]willing, I \[C/E]give you cons\[F]ent!
\[D&]Fire and \[F]blood's a \[G]stifling \[E&]scent..
\endverse

\beginverse
\[A&]Squandering passion has\[E&] left me beref\[F]t
Ex\[G]hausted and \[C]spent - there's no \[C/E]fight in me \[F]left
Should I \[D&]just lay \[F]down and \[G]wait for \[E&]death?
Am \[A&]I self-absorbed, or am \[E&]I self ob\[F]sessed?
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[A7sus4]Give me the spotlight, I'll \[E7]hide in the \[H&]wings
It's \[A/C#]not even clear what I \[A7/D]want
Tell \[E]friends that I'm quitting for the \[F#m7]millionth time
Get \[D*]mad when they respond nonchalant\[D/C#]
\[A7sus4]Everyone fakes that they're \[E7]doing so \[H&]great
\[A/C#]No-one's admitting it's \[A7/D]hard
Well, I can \[E]fake a half-smile use big \[F#m]words and act smart
But I \[D]can't fake not having an awful, rancorous \[A&]heart!

\beginchorus
\[A7sus4]Further on down I can \[E7]feel in my \[H&]core
that there's so\[A/C#]mething important am\[A7/D]iss
And you'd \[E]think I should know that I \[F#m7]shouldn't compare
and \[D]just fuckin get on with it
\[A7sus4]Give me the spotlight I'll \[E7]hide in the \[H&]wings.
\[A/C#]Tell me to sit and I'll \[A7/D]fly
I \[E]look like an old man and I \[F#m]act like a kid
And I \[D]live like I'm ready to die
\[A7sus4]No-one improves from f\[E7]eeling cont\[H&]ent.
We \[A/C#]risk it and pull it \[A7/D]apart
I can \[E]half-fake politeness and \[F#m7]witty remarks
But I \[D]can't fake not owning a caring, yet \[F]ranco\[G]rous \[A]heart!
