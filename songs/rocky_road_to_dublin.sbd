\beginverse
In the \[A&]merry \[G]month of \[A&]June from my home I started
\[A&]Left the \[G]girls of \[A&]Tuam \[G]nearly broken-hearted
Sal\[A&]uted F\[G]ather \[A&]dear kissed my darlin' Mother
\[A&]Drank a \[G]pint of \[A&]beer me \[G]grief and tears to smother
Then \[A&]off to reap the \[G]corn, l\[A&]eave where I was b\[G]orn
\[A&]Cut a stout black\[G]thorn to \[G]banish ghosts and goblins
\[A&]Brand new pair of\[G] brogues, \[A&]rattlin' o'er the\[G] bogs
\[A&]Frightenin' all the \[G]dogs \[G]on the rocky road to Dublin
O\[E]{ne two} thr\[G]{ee four} five\[A&]
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[A&]Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road
And \[G]all the ways to Dublin 
W\[E&]hack fo\[G]lol-le-r\[A&]ah
\endchorus

\beginverse
In \[A&]Mullin\[G]gar that \[A&]night I rested limbs so weary
\[A&]Started \[G]by day\[A&]light me \[G]spirits bright and airy
\[A&]Took a \[G]drop of the \[A&]pure to keep my heart from sinking
\[A&]That's tbe \[G]Paddy's \[A&]cure whene'e\[G]r he's on for drinking
To \[A&]see the lassies \[G]smile l\[A&]aughing all the w\[G]hile
\[A&]At me curious \[G]style 'twould s\[G]et your heart a-bubbling
And \[A&]asked if I was \[G]hired, w\[A&]ages I req\[G]uired
Till \[A&]{I was} nearly \[G]tired \[G]of the rocky road to Dublin
O\[E]{ne two} thr\[G]{ee four} five\[A&]

\refchorus

\beginverse
In \[A&]Dublin \[G]next ar\[A&]rived I thought it such a pity
To \[A&]be so \[G]soon de\[A&]prived a \[G]view of that fine city
Well \[A&]then I \[G]took a \[A&]stroll out among the quality
\[A&]Bundle \[G]it was \[A&]stole all \[G]in a neat locality
\[A&]Something crossed me \[G]mind w\[A&]hen I looked beh\[G]ind
No \[A&]bundle could I f\[G]ind up\[G]on me stick a-wobblin'
En\[A&]quiring for the \[G]rogue they s\[A&]aid me Connaught b\[G]rogue
\[A&]Wasn't much in \[G]vogue \[G]on the rocky road to Dublin
O\[E]{ne two} thr\[G]{ee four} five\[A&]
\endverse

\refchorus

\beginverse
From \[A&]there I \[G]got a\[A&]way me spirits never failing
\[A&]Landed \[G]on the \[A&]quay just \[G]as the ship was sailing
\[A&]Captain \[G]at me \[A&]roared said that no room had he
\[A&]When I \[G]jumped a\[A&]board a c\[G]abin found for Paddy
\[A&]Down among the \[G]pigs I p\[A&]layed some funny r\[G]igs
\[A&]Danced some hearty \[G]jigs the w\[G]ater round me bubblin'
When \[A&]off to Holy\[G]head I \[A&]wished meself was \[G]dead
Or \[A&]better far ins\[G]tead on\[G] the rocky road to Dublin
O\[E]{ne two} thr\[G]{ee four} five\[A&]
\endverse

\refchorus

\beginverse
The \[A&]boys of \[G]Liver\[A&]pool when we safely landed
\[A&]Called me\[G]self a \[A&]fool I c\[G]ould no longer stand it
\[A&]Blood be\[G]gan to \[A&]boil temper I was losin'
\[A&]Poor old \[G]Erin's \[A&]isle \[G]they began abusin'
"Hurr\[A&]ah me soul!" says I \[G]let my s\[A&]hillelagh fly\[G]
Some \[A&]Galway boys were \[G]nigh and s\[G]aw I was a hobble in
\[A&]With a loud "Hur\[G]ray!" j\[A&]oined in the aff\[G]ray
We \[A&]quickly cleared the \[G]way f\[G]or the rocky road to Dublin
O\[E]{ne two} thr\[G]{ee four} five\[A&]
