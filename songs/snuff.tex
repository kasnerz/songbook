B\[A&]ury all your secrets i\[E&]n my \[F]skin\[C]
C\[A&]ome away with innocence, a\[E&]nd l\[F]eave me with my sins\[C]
T\[A&]he air around me still feel\[E&]s like a \[F]cage\[C]
A\[A&]nd love is just a camouflage \[E&]for w\[F]hat resembles rage again\ldots

\beginchorus
So if you love me, let m\[G]e go. 
And run away befor\[A&]e I know.
My heart is just too dark to \[G]care. 
I can't destroy what isn't\[A&] there.
Deliver me into my f\[G]ate
If I'm alone I cannot h\[A&]ate
I don't deserve to have\[G] you\ldots
My s\[F]mile was taken long ago
If I can change I hope I nev\[A&]er know

I st\[A&]ill press your letter\[E&]s to my \[F]lips\[C]
And c\[A&]herish them in parts of me\[E&] that s\[F]avor every kiss\[C]
I c\[A&]ouldn't face a life without\[E&] your \[F]light\[C]
But \[A&]all of that was ripped a\[E&]part
\[F] when you refused to fight\[C]
\endverse

\beginchorus
So save your breath, I will not \[G]hear
I think I made it very cl\[A&]ear
You couldn't hate enough t\[G]o love
Is that supposed to be eno\[A&]ugh?
I only wish you weren't my f\[G]riend
Then I could hurt you in the \[A&]end
I never claimed to be a sa\[G]int\ldots
My o\[F]wn was banished long ago
It took the death of hope to let y\[A&]ou go

\beginchorus
So break yourself against my s\[G]tones
And spit your pity in my \[A&]soul
You never needed any \[G]help
You sold me out to save y\[A&]ourself
And I won't listen to y\[G]our shame
You ran away - you're all th\[A&]e same
Angels lie to keep \[G]control…
My l\[F]ove was punished long ago
If you still care, don't ever let me \[A&]know\[E&]\[F]
If you still care, \[C]don't ever let me \[A&]know\ldots\[E&]\[F]\[C]
