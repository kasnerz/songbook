\beginsong{So Far Away}[by={\normalsize Avenged Sevenfold}]
\beginverse
\[E&]Never feared for anything
\[E&]Never shamed but never free
A \[G]life to heal the \[D]broken heart
With \[H&]all that it \[C]could
\endverse

\beginverse
\[E&]Lived the life so endlessly
\[E&]Saw beyond what others see
I \[G]tried to heal your \[D]broken heart
With \[H&]all that I \[C]could
\endverse

\beginverse
\[C]Will you stay
\[D]Will you stay away forever?
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[E&]How do I live without the \[G]ones I love?
\[A&]Time still turns the pages of the \[Em/G]book, it's \[D]burned
\[E&]Place and time, always \[G]on my mind
I \[A&]have so much to say but you're so \[C]far a\[D]way
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[E&]Plans of what our futures hold
\[E&]Foolish lies of growing old
It s\[G]eems we're so i\[D]nvincible
The \[H&]truth is so \[C]cold
\endverse

\beginverse
\[E&]A final song, a last request
\[E&]A perfect chapter laid to rest
\[G]Now and then I \[D]try to find
The \[H&]place in my \[C]mind
\endverse

\beginverse
\[C]Where you can stay
\[D]You can stay awake forever
\endverse
