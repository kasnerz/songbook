\beginverse
I have o\[E&]ften told you stories
\[D]About the way
I l\[E&]ived the life of a drifter
\[H&]  waiting for the day
When I'd t\[E&]ake your hand and sing you songs
Then m\[D]aybe you would say
\[E&]Come lay with me and love me
\[H&]  And I would surely stay
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[G]  But I \[A]feel I'm growing \[E&]older
\[C]And the son\[D]gs that I have su\[G]ng
E\[H]cho in the di\[E&]stance
Like the so\[D]und
Of a w\[G]indmill going r\[C]ound
\[A&]Guess I'll always \[H&]be
A soldier of f\[E&]ortune.
\endchorus

\beginverse
Many t\[E&]imes I've been a traveller
I lo\[D]oked for something new
In days of o\[E&]ld when nights were cold
\[H&]   I wandered without you
\[E&]But those days I thought my eyes
\[D]Had seen you standing near
\[E&]Though blindness is confusing
\[H&]It shows that you're not here.
\endverse

\refchorus

\beginchorus
Yes, \[E&]I can hear the \[D]sound
of a wi\[G]ndmill going\[C] round
I g\[A&]uess I'll always \[H&]be
a soldier of f\[E&]ortune.
I g\[C]uess I'll always\[Hm7] be
a soldier of f\[E]ortune.
