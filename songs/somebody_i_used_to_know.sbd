\[D&]Told my\[C]self that you were \[D&]right for m\[C]e
\[D&]But felt so l\[C]onely in your \[D&]company\[C]
\[D&]But that was l\[C]ove and it's an a\[D&]che I sti\[C]ll rem\[D&]ember\[C]\[D&]\[C]

\[D&]You can get add\[C]icted to a c\[D&]ertain k\[C]ind of s\[D&]adness\[C]\[D&]\[C]
\[D&]Like resign\[C]ation to the \[D&]end, \[C]always the \[D&]end\[C]\[D&]\[C]
\[D&]So when we f\[C]ound that we could \[D&]not make se\[C]nse

\[D&]But you \[C]didn't have to \[B]cut me \[C]off
\[D&]Make out l\[C]ike it never \[B]happened
And that \[C]we were not\[D&]hing
And \[C]I don't even n\[B]eed your \[C]love
But you t\[D&]reat me like a s\[C]tranger
And that f\[B]eels so r\[C]ough
\[D&]You di\[C]dn't have to st\[B]oop so l\[C]ow
\[D&]Have your f\[C]riends collect your \[B]records
And then c\[C]hange your n\[D&]umber
I \[C]guess that I don't \[B]need that th\[C]ough

\[D&]But had me b\[C]elieving it was a\[D&]lways something \[C]that I'd \[D&]done\[C]\[D&]\[C]
\[C]And I don't wanna live that way
\[C]Reading into every word you say
\[C]You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know
