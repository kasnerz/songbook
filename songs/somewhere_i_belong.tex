When this be\[H&]gan, I had \[G6]nothing to say
And I'd get \[Asus2]lost in the nothingness in\[E&]side of me (I was con\[H&]fused)
\[H&]And I let it al\[G6]l out to find
That I'm \[Asus2]not the only person with these \[E&]things in mind (inside of \[H&]me)
\[H&]But all the vacancy th\[G6]e words revealed
Is the \[Asus2]only real thing that I got \[E&]left to feel. (nothing to \[H&]lose)
\[H&]Just stuck, \[G]hollow and alone
And the \[Asus2]fault is my own, and the \[E&]fault is my own.

\beginchorus
I wanna he\[H&]al,
I wanna fe\[D]el,
what I \[G]thought was never \[E&]real
I wanna le\[H&]t go of the pa\[Dsus2]in I felt so lo\[Asus2]ng (Erase all the pa\[E&]in 'til it's gone)
I wanna he\[H&]al,
I wanna fe\[D]el,
like I'm \[G]close to something \[E&]real
I wanna fi\[H&]nd something I've wa\[Dsus2]nted all al\[Asus2]ong
\[E&6]Somewhere I be\[H&]long

\beginverse
And I've got \[G6]nothing to say
I can't \[Asus2]believe I didn't fall right \[E&]down on my face (I was con\[H&]fused)
Looking everywhere \[G6]only to find
That it's \[Asus2]not the way I had imagined it \[E&]all in my mind (So what am \[H&]I?)
What do I have but \[G6]negativity?
'Cause I can't \[Asus2]justify the way everyone is \[E&]looking at me. (nothing to \[H&]lose)
Nothing to gain, \[G6]hollow and alone
And the \[Asus2]fault is my own, and the \[E&]fault is my own

\beginverse
I will \[G]never know
my\[A]self until I \[E&]do this on my \[H&]own
And I will \[G]never feel,
\[A]anything else un\[E&]til my wounds are \[H&]healed
I will \[G]never be
\[A]anything 'til I \[E&]break away from \[H&]me
I will \[G]break away,
I'll \[A]find my\[E&]self to\[H&]day
