\beginverse
Am I loud and \[E&]clear or am \[G]I breaking \[Cadd9]up?
Am I still your \[E&]charm or am \[G]I just \[Cadd9]bad luck?
Are \[E&]we getting \[G]closer, or are \[Cadd9]we just getting more \[Dsus2]lost?
I'll show you \[E&]mine if you \[G]show me yours \[Cadd9]first
Let's compare \[E&]scars I'll \[G]tell you \[Cadd9]whose is worse
Let's \[E&]unwrite these \[G]pages and re\[Cadd9]place them with our \[Dsus2]own words
\endverse

\beginchorus
We \[E&]live on front \[G]porches and \[Cadd9]swing life away
We \[E&]get by just \[G]fine here on \[Cadd9]minimum \[Dsus2]wage
If \[E&]love is a \[G]labor I'll \[Cadd9]slave 'til the \[Dsus2]end
I \[E&]won't cross these \[G]streets until \[Cadd9]you hold my \[Dsus2]hand
\endchorus

\beginverse
I've been here so \[E&]long; think that \[G]its time to \[Cadd9]move
The winter's so \[E&]cold summer's \[G]over \[Cadd9]too soon
so \[E&]let's pack our \[G]bags and \[Cadd9]settle down where palm \[Dsus2]trees grow
I've got some \[E&]friends, some that \[G]I hardly \[Cadd9]know
But we've had some \[E&]times I wouldn't \[G]trade for the \[Cadd9]world
We chase these \[E&]days down with \[G]talks of the \[Cadd9]places that we \[Dsus2]will go
\endverse
