\caponote[2]
\beginverse
\[G]  Almost Heaven\[E&], West Virginia\[D],
 Blue Ridge Mountains, \[C]Shenandoah \[G]River.
\[G]  Life is old there, \[E&]older than the trees, 
\[D]younger than the mountains, \[C]blowin' like a br\[G]eeze.
\endverse

\beginchorus
Country \[G]Roads, take me \[D7]home, to the \[E&]place I be\[C]long
West Vir\[G]ginia, mountain \[D]mama, take me \[C]home, country \[G]roads.
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[G] All my memories\[E&]  gather 'round her\[D], 
miner's lady, \[C]stranger to blue \[G]water.
\[G]  Dark and dusty, \[E&]painted on the sky, 
\[D]misty taste of moonshine, \[C]teardrop in my \[G]eye.
\endverse

\refchorus

\beginverse
\[E&] I hear her \[D]voice, in the \[G]mornin' hour she calls me.
The \[C]radio re\[G]minds me of my \[D]home far away.
And \[E&]drivin' down the \[F]road I get a \[C]feelin' that I \[G]should have been home
\[D]yesterday, yester\[D7]day.
\endverse

\beginverse
Take me \[D]home, (down) country \[G]roads.
Take me \[D]home, (down) country \[G]roads.
