\[Dsus2]The word had spread from door to \[G]door
Down the \[Dsus2]Barachois Road to the harbour \[Cadd9]shore
Old \[Dsus2]Joe LaBelle would steal the \[G]house from the \[Dsus2]Widow Victori\[Cadd9]a.
He'd \[Dsus2]found some deed that claimed her \[G]land
And a \[Dsus2]handshake deal just wouldn't \[Cadd9]stand
In a \[Dsus2]court of law he did de\[G]mand that the \[Dsus2]house belonged to \[Cadd9]him.
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[E&]Ring the church bells \[C]in the night
We'll \[G]gather at the \[D]first star light
\[E&]Bring your lamps, \[C]sleighs, and mare
To \[G]save the Widow's \[D]home
\[E&]Across the big field, \[C]o'er the pond
We'll \[G]move this house bef\[D]ore the dawn.
When \[E&]Joe LaBelle arr\[C]ives he'll find his \[G]prize already \[D]gone.

\[Dsus2]It seems that some mistake was \[G]made
On the \[Dsus2]day her husband made the \[Cadd9]trade
\[Dsus2]When he died he was bet\[G]rayed by \[Dsus2]Joe LaBelle's black \[Cadd9]heart
He \[Dsus2]planned to force her to the \[G]cold
And he'd \[Dsus2]bring the sheriff and his \[Cadd9]fold
So \[Dsus2]through the dead of winter's \[G]hold, we'd \[Dsus2]come to save her \[C]home\[G]\[C]\[G]\[C]

You could \[E&]see his breath \[C]freeze in the \[G]air
As \[E&]Par√© Felix \[C]said the Lord's \[G]prayer
\[E&]Passed the wine \[C]to all hands \[G]there
\[C]     Then he sang a sailor's \[D]song.

There \[Dsus2]must have been near 40 \[G]men
While their w\[Dsus2]ives all held their lamps for \[Cadd9]them
They \[Dsus2]fashioned logs, levers and \[G]skids while\[Dsus2] shivering to the \[Cadd9]bone
With \[Dsus2]winches, logs and Dino's \[G]sleigh
They \[Dsus2]slowly hauled the house a\[Cadd9]way
And the i\[Dsus2]ce cracked like the \[G]break of day as \[Dsus2]across it she was \[Cadd9]drawn.
\endverse


\beginchorus
We rang the church bells in the night
We worked until the morning light
Brought our lamps, sleighs, and mare
To save the Widow's home
Across the big field, o'er the pond
We moved this house before the dawn
Joe LaBelle arrived and found his prize already gone.
