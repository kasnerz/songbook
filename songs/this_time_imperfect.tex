\beginverse
\[G] I cannot \[Dsus2]leave here, I cannot stay\[E&],
\[G] Forever \[Dsus2]haunted, more than afraid\[E&].
\[G] Asphyxiate \[Dsus2]{on words} I would say,\[E&]
\[G] I'm drawn \[Dsus2]{to a blackened} sky as I \[E&]turn \[G]blue.
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[E&]There are no flowers, no not this ti\[G]me,
There'll be no angels gracing the li\[Dsus2]nes,
Just these stark wo\[C]rds, I find\[E&].
\[E&]I'd show a smile, but I'm too we\[G]ak,
I'd share with you could I only s\[Dsus2]peak,
Just how much th\[C]is, hurts m\[E&]e.
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[G] I cannot \[Dsus2]stay here, I cannot leave\[E&],
\[G] Just like \[Dsus2]{all I loved}, I make beli\[E&]eve.
\[G] Imagine \[Dsus2]heart, I disappe\[E&]ar, seems,
\[G] No one will \[Dsus2]appear, here and make \[E&]me real.

\[E&]I'd tell you how it ha\[Dsus2]unts me,
\[E&]I'd tell you how it ha\[Dsus2]unts me,
\textit{(cuts through my day, and sinks into my dreams.)}
I'd tell you how it haunts me,
\textit{(cuts through my day, and sinks into my dreams.)}
\[E&]You don't care that it h\[Asus2]aunts me\ldots oh!
