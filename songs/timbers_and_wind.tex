\beginverse
Now there \[A&]once was a time when the northerners sang
of a king \[G]they had crowned: more a boy than a man,
More a \[F]pup than a wolf, with the cold of the realm in his \[A&]eyes
\endverse

\beginverse
He’d b\[A&]roken a vow to the lords of the Twins:
Wed a \[G]stranger, a beauty, but a promise there’d been
So the \[F]Lord Frey demanded a bridegroom as comp\[A&]romise
\endverse

\beginchorus
   And the \[F]timbers \[C]groaned
River \[G]wind softly \[A&]moaned,
“Oh, the \[F]King in the North doesn't \[G]know
How a red wedding goe\[A&]s.”
\endchorus

\beginverse
Well, the \[A&]feasting was plenty and the singing in tune
And the \[G]Stark wolves, they howled ‘neath their northern moon
So \[F]loud were their cries that the closing of doors was dro\[A&]wned out
\endverse

\beginverse
Lady C\[A&]atelyn alone had the river’s sharp ear
Heard da\[G]ncing reels turn to the Rains of Castamere
In her sk\[F]in and bones growled a creature of\[A&] doubt
\endverse

\beginchorus
   And the t\[F]imbers \[C]groaned
River \[G]wind softly \[A&]moaned,
“Oh, the \[F]King in the North soon will kn\[G]ow
How a red wedding g\[A&]oes.”
\endchorus

\beginverse
There were a\[A&]rrows and daggers and the touch of them burned
\endverse
\beginverse
From p\[G]layers to slayers in an instant were turned
And the f\[F]oreigner Queen was the first to fall under the \[A&]knife
\endverse

\beginverse
With t\[A&]wo arrows in him, the King crawled to her side
While his \[G]mother, she pleaded for the Lord to subside
But he’d t\[F]aken their word, and to break it meant no right to\[A&] life
\endverse

\beginchorus
   And the \[F]timbers \[C]groaned
River \[G]wind softly \[A&]moaned,
“Oh, the \[F]King in the North, now he kno\[G]ws
How a red wedding go\[A&]es.”
\endchorus

\beginverse
Lord \[A&]Bolton approached; with a thrust to Robb’s heart
He \[G]gave him the Lannister Lions’ regards
And the \[F]king’s mother wept, for his last word had called her to \[A&]him
\endverse

\beginverse
There was \[A&]nothing she felt cutting Lady Frey’s throat
And she f\[G]elt nothing more when they slashed her own
The \[F]North will remember, she thought, and they’ll have all \[A&]your skins
\endverse

\beginchorus
   And the \[F]timbers \[C]groaned
Now the \[G]wolves lie \[A&]below
Oh, the \[F]King in the North, if he’d \[G]known
How a red wedding \[A&]goes
\endchorus

\beginchorus
 And the \[F]timbers \[C]groan
But the \[G]North waits; they \[A&]know
That o\[F]ne day the blood they are \[G]owed
Will run ‘neath their s\[A&]oles
Run 'neath their s\[A&]oles
Run 'neath their s\[A&]oles.
\endchorus
\endsong
