\beginsong{The Times They Are A-Changin'}[by={\normalsize Bob Dylan}]
\beginverse
Come \[G]gather 'round \[E&]people wher\[C]ever you \[G]roam
And ad\[G]mit that the \[A&]waters a\[C]round you have \[D]grown
And ac\[G]cept it that \[E&]soon you'll be \[C]drenched to the \[G]bone
If your \[G]time to \[A&]you is worth \[D]savin'
Then you \[D]better start \[D7]swimmin' or you'll \[D6]sink like a \[D]stone,
For the \[G]times, they \[C]are a-\[D]chan\[G]gin'
\endverse

\beginverse
Come \[G]writers and \[E&]critics who prophe\[C]size with your \[G]pen
And \[G]keep your eyes \[A&]wide the chance \[C]won't come a\[D]gain
And \[G]don't speak too \[E&]soon for the \[C]wheel's still in \[G]spin
And there's \[G]no tellin' \[A&]who that it's \[D]namin'
For the l\[D]oser now\[D7] will be \[D6]later to \[D]win
For the \[G]times they \[C]are a-\[D]chan\[G]gin'
\endverse

\beginverse
Come \[G]senators, \[E&]congressmen \[C]please heed the \[G]call
Don't \[G]stand in the \[A&]doorway, don't \[C]block up the \[D]hall
For \[G]he that gets \[E&]hurt will be \[C]he who has \[G]stalled
There's a \[G]battle out\[A&]side \[D]ragin'
It'll soo\[D]n shake your w\[D7]indows and \[D6]rattle your \[D]walls
For the \[G]times they \[C]are a-\[D]chan\[G]gin'
\endverse

\beginverse
Come \[G]mothers and \[E&]fathers \[C]throughout the \[G]land
And \[G]don't criti\[A&]cize what you \[C]can't under\[D]stand
Your \[G]sons and your \[E&]daughters are be\[C]yond your com\[G]mand
Your \[G]old road is \[A&]rapidly \[D]agin'
Please ge\[D]t out of the n\[D7]ew one if you \[D6]can't lend a \[D]hand
For the \[G]times they \[C]are a-\[D]chan\[G]gin'
\endverse

\beginverse
The \[G]line it is \[E&]drawn the \[C]curse it is \[G]cast
The \[G]slow one \[A&]now will \[C]later be \[D]fast
As the \[G]present \[E&]now will \[C]later be \[G]past
The \[G]order is \[A&]rapidly \[D]fadin'
And the f\[D]irst one n\[D7]ow will \[D6]later be \[D]last
For the \[G]times they \[C]are a-\[D]chan\[G]gin'
\endverse
