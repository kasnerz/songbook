\[A&]the toxicity of our \[C]city, of our city
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[A&]Now what do you own the world, how do you own
\[F]disorder, \[E]disorder
\[A&]Now somewhere between the sacred silence
\[F]sacred silence and \[E]sleep
\[A&]Somewhere, between the

\[A&]Disorder, disorder,
\[F]disord\[E]er
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[A&]More wood for the \[C]fires, loud neighbors
\[A&]Flashlight reveries caught in the \[C]headlights of a truck
\[A&]eating seeds as a \[C]pastime activity
\[A&]the toxicity of our ci\[C]ty, of our city
\endverse
