\beginverse
Getting crazy on the \[D&]waltzers,\[F] but it's the life that I \[C]choose
\[G]Sing about the sixblade sing about the switchback\[D&] and a torture tatoo
And I've been riding on a\[F] ghost train
where the cars they \[C]scream and slam
And I don't know where I'll \[G]be tonight but I'd \[D&]always tell you where I am
In a screaming ring of \[F]faces
I saw her standing in the \[C]light
She had a ticket for the \[G]races just like me she was a \[D&]victim of the night
I put my hand upon the \[F]lever
said let it rock and let it \[C]roll
I had the one arm \[G]bandit fever there was an \[D&]arrow through my heart and my soul
\endverse

\beginchorus
And the big wheel keep on \[B]turning\[C]
neon \[F]burning, up a\[B]bove
And I'm just\[F] high on the world
\[F]come \[C]on take a \[D&]low ride with me \[B]girl. \[C]
On the \[D&]tunnel of love, \[C]ye\[D&]ah, \[B]love
\endchorus

\beginverse
It's just the \[D&]danger, \[F] when you're riding at \[C]your own risk
She said ``You are the perfect \[G]stranger'', and she said \[D&]``Baby, let's keep it like this''
It's just a \[F]cakewalk, twisting baby, 
yeah, s\[C]tep right up and say
\[G]``Hey mister, give me two give me two now, 'cause \[D&]any two can play''
\endverse

\refchorus

\beginverse
Well it's been \[G&]money for muscle on another \[B]whirligig
\[G&]Money for muscle, and \[B]another girl I dig
\[G&]Another hustle, just to - just to \[B]make it big,
and \[C]rock away rock away
\endverse

\beginverse
And \[F]girl, it looks so pretty to me,\[C]\[D&] just like it always did\[B]
\[C]Like the Spanish city to me,\[F] when \[B]we were kids.\[C]

\beginverse
She took off a silver \[D&]locket\[F]
She said remember me \[C]by this
She put her hand in my \[G]pocket,
I got a \[D&]keepsake and a kiss
And in the roar of dust and \[F]diesel,
I stood and watched her walk \[C]away
\[G]I could have caught up with her easy enough, but \[D&]something must have made me stay
\endverse

\refchorus

\beginverse
And now I'm \[G&]searching through these carousels and the \[B]carnival arcades
\[G&]Searching everywhere from steeplec\[B]hase to palisades
In \[G&]any shooting gallery where \[B]promises are made,
To \[C]rockaway rockaway, \rep{2} from Cullercoats to Whitley bay, out to \[C]rockaway
\endverse

\beginverse
And \[F]girl, it looks so pretty to me,\[C] \[D&] like it always did\[B]
\[C]Like the Spanish city to me, \[F] \[B]when we were kids.\[C]
