\[A&]New blood joins this e\[E&]arth  and q\[D]uickly he's sub-\[A&]dued.
Through constant pain dis\[E&]grace, the \[D]young boy learns their \[A&]rules.
With time the child draws \[E&]in this w\[D]hipping boy done w\[A&]rong.
Deprived of all his t\[E&]houghts, the \[D]young man struggles \[A&]on and  on.
He knows,  a  v\[C]ow unto  his o\[G]wn that n\[A&]ever from this day
his w\[C]ill they'll take a - \[G]way.\[E]\[A&]

\beginchorus
\[A&]What I've f\[C]elt, what I've k\[G]nown
Never s\[E&]hined through in what I've s\[A&]hown.
N\[A&]ever \[C]be, never s\[G]ee. 
Won't s\[E]ee what might have b\[A&]een.
W\[A&]hat I've f\[C]elt, what I've k\[G]nown, 
never s\[E&]hined through in what I've s\[A&]hown.
N\[A&]ever f\[C]ree, never \[G]me. 
So I \[E]dub thee unfor\[A&]given.

Throughout the life the s\[E&]ame, he's b\[D]attled constan\[A&]tly
This fight he cannot w\[E&]in. A t\[D]ired man they s\[A&]ee no longer cares.
The o\[C]ld man then p\[G]repares to d\[A&]ie regretfully
That o\[C]ld man here is \[G]me.\[E]\[A&]
