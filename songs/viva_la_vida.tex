\beginverse
I used to \[C]rule the \[D]world
Seas would \[G]rise when I gave the \[E&]word
Now in the morning I \[C]sleep al\[D]one
Sweep the \[G]streets I used to \[E&]own\[C]\[D]\[G]\[E&]
\endverse

\beginverse
I used to\[C] roll the \[D]dice
Feel the f\[G]ear in my enemy's \[E&]eyes
Listen as the \[C]crowd would s\[D]ing:
"Now the o\[G]ld king is dead! L\[E&]ong live the king!"
One minute I \[C]held the \[D]key
Next the \[G]walls were closed on \[E&]me
And I discovered that my c\[C]astles st\[D]and
Upon \[G]pillars of salt and p\[E&]illars of sand
\endverse

\beginchorus
I \[C]hear Jerusalem \[D]bells are ringing
\[G]Roman Cavalry \[E&]choirs are singing
\[C]Be my mirror, my \[D]sword, and shield
My \[G]missionaries in a \[E&]foreign field
\[C]For some reason I \[D]can't explain
\[G]Once you go there was \[E&]never, never an \[C]honest \[D]word
That was \[H&]when I ruled the \[E&]world \[C]\[D]\[G]\[E&]
\endchorus

\beginverse
It was the wicked and\[C] wild \[D]wind
Blew down the \[G]doors to let me \[E&]in.
Shattered windows and the \[C]sound of \[D]drums
People \[G]couldn't believe what\[E&] I'd become
Revolutio\[C]naries \[D]wait
For my h\[G]ead on a silver \[E&]plate
Just a puppet on a \[C]lonely \[D]string
Oh \[G]who would ever want to be \[E&]king?
\endverse
