I've paid my \[D&]dues\[Am7]
Time after \[D&]time\[Am7]
I've done my \[D&]sentence\[Am7]
But committed no \[D&]crime\[Am7]
And bad mis\[F]takes,\[B] I've made a \[F]few\[B]
I've had my \[F]share of sand \[C/E]kicked in my \[D&]face
But \[G7]I've come \[C]through
And I need to go \[G7sus4/C]on,     \[C]and \[G7sus4/C]on,     \[C]and \[G7sus4/C]on,   and \[D]on
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[G]We are the \[H&]champions, my\[E&] friends\[C]\[D]
And \[G]we'll keep on \[H&]fighting 'till the\[C] end\[E7]
\[A&]We are the \[D7]champions
\[C&]We are the \[Cdim7]champions
\[G]No time for l\[Fadd9/A]osers
'Cause \[A#6]we are the c\[C]hampions\[D7sus4]\[D7sus4]
Of the w\[G&]orld\[Am]\[G&]\[Am7/G]\[G&]\[Am7]
\endchorus

\beginverse
I've taken my \[D&]bows\[Am7]
And my curtain \[D&]calls\[Am7]
You brought me \[D&]fame and fortune and everything that goe\[Am7]s with it
I thank you \[D&]all\[Am7]
But it's been no bed of \[F]roses\[B], no pleasure \[F]cruise\[B]
I consider it a \[F]challenge before the \[C/E]whole human\[D&] race
And \[G7]I ain't gonna \[C]lose
And I need to go \[G7sus4]on,     \[C]and \[G7sus4]on,     \[C]and \[G7sus4]on,   and \[D]on
