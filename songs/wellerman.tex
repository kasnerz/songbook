\beginsong{Wellerman}[by={\normalsize Nathan Evans / Traditional}]
\beginverse
There \[A&]once was a ship that \[A&]put to sea
The \[D&]name of the ship was the \[A&]Billy of Tea
The w\[A&]inds blew up, her \[A&]bow dipped down
O b-\[E]low, my bully boys, \[A&]blow
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[F]Soon may the \[C]Wellerman come
To \[D&]bring us sugar and \[A&]tea and rum
\[F]One day, when the \[C]tonguin’ is done,
We’ll \[E]take our leave and \[A&]go
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[A&]She'd not been two \[A&]weeks from shore
When \[D&]down on her a \[A&]right whale bore
The \[A&]captain called all \[A&]hands and swore
He'd \[E]take that whale in \[A&]tow, huh!
\endverse

\refchorus

\beginverse
\[F]Da da da-\[C]da dat da
Da-\[D&]da dat da da-da \[A&]da dat da
\[F]Da da da-\[C]da dat da
Da-\[E]da dat da dat \[A&]da
\endverse

\beginverse
Be\[A&]fore the boat had \[A&]hit the water
The \[D&]wha-le's tail came \[A&]up and caught her
All h\[A&]ands to the side, har\[A&]pooned and fought her
\[E]When she dived down \[A&]low
\endverse

\refchorus

\beginverse
No \[A&]line was cut, no \[A&]whale was freed
The \[D&]captain's mind was \[A&]not of greed
And \[A&]he belonged to the \[A&]whaleman's creed
She \[E]took that ship in \[A&]tow
\endverse

\refchorus

\beginverse
\[F]Da da da-\[C]da dat da
Da-\[D&]da dat da da-da \[A&]da dat da
\[F]Da da da-\[C]da dat da
Da-\[E]da dat da dat \[A&]da
\endverse

\beginverse
For \[A&]forty days, or \[A&]even more
The \[D&]line went slack, then \[A&]tight once more
All \[A&]boats were lost, there were \[A&]only four
But \[E]still that whale did \[A&]go
\endverse

\refchorus

\beginverse
As \[A&]far as I've heard, the \[A&]fight's still on
The \[D&]line's not cut and the \[A&]whale's not gone
The \[A&]Wellerman makes his \[A&]regular call
To en\[D&]courage the Captain, \[A&]crew, and all
\endverse
