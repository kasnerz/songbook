\[D&]Mail order \[A#]brides, t\[F]urtlenecks, and t\[C]rophy wives
\[D&]Had the ways and \[A#]means to breach
\[F]The borders of \[C]easy street
\[F]And to blend right \[C]in
We all \[F]surrounded them
In a \[A#]white picket f\[F]ence
Now \[C]both ends \[F]meet
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[A#]Sufficed to say theres a time and a place
\[D&]So I wait
For the \[F]tug-of-war and who you'll \[C]pull for
\[A#]While between you and me from point A to point B is a f\[D&]ine line
That \[F]burns at both our \[C]good ends
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[D&]Two peas in a \[A#]pod, a battl\[F]eaxe, and a b\[C]astard child
\[D&]took one step m\[A#]ore

\[F]and to blend right \[C]in
they opened \[F]fire with
their \[A#]rain checks spent
to \[F]make \[C]ends \[F]meet
\endverse
