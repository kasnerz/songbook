\[C]So, so you think you can t\[D/F#]ell,
heaven from h\[Am/E]ell, 
blue skies from pa\[G]in.
Can you tell a green \[D/F#]field 
from a cold steel ra\[C]il, 
a smile from a ve\[A&]il,
Do you think you can t\[G]ell?
\endverse

\beginverse
Did they get you to tr\[C]ade 
your heroes for \[D/F#]ghosts,
Hot ashes for tr\[Am/E]ees, 
hot air for a coo\[G]l breeze, 
cold comfort for cha\[D/F#]nge,
And did you exchan\[C]ge 
a walk on part in the \[A&]war 
for a lead role in a ca\[G]ge?

\[C]How I wish, how I wish you were \[D/F#]here.
We're just \[Am/E]two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, 
\[G]year after year,
\[D/F#] Running over the same old ground. 
\[C]What have we found?
The same old \[A&]fears. 
Wish you were here..\[G].
