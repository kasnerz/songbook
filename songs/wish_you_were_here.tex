\[C]So, so you think you can t\[D/F#]ell,
heaven from h\[Am/E]ell,
blue skies from pa\[G]in.
Can you tell a green \[D/F#]field
from a cold steel ra\[C]il,
a smile from a ve\[A&]il,
Do you think you can t\[G]ell?

\beginverse
Did they get you to tr\[C]ade
your heroes for \[D/F#]ghosts,
Hot ashes for tr\[Am/E]ees,
hot air for a coo\[G]l breeze,
cold comfort for cha\[D/F#]nge,
And did you exchan\[C]ge
a walk on part in the \[A&]war
for a lead role in a ca\[G]ge?

\[C]How I wish, how I wish you were \[D/F#]here.
We're just \[Am/E]two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl,
\[G]year after year,
\[D/F#] Running over the same old ground.
\[C]What have we found?
The same old \[A&]fears.
Wish you were here..\[G].
