\[E&]Another h\[Cmaj7]ead hangs lowly \[G6]child is slowly t\[D/F#]aken
\[E&]And the violence \[Cmaj7]caused such silence \[G6]who are we mista\[D/F#]ken
But you \[E&]see it's not me, it's not \[C]my family,
In your \[G]head, in your head, they are fig\[D/F#]hting
With their \[E&]tanks and their bombs and their bombs\[C] and their guns in your head,\[G]
in your head, they are cr\[D/F#]ying.

In your \[E&]head, in your \[C]head, zombie,\[G] zombie, zombi\[D]e
What's in your \[E&]head, in your \[C]head, zombie,\[G] zombie, zombi\[D]e

\[E&]Anothers m\[Cmaj7]other's breaking h\[G6]eart is taking \[D/F#]over.
\[E&]When the violence \[Cmaj7]causes silence, \[G6]we must be mi\[D/F#]staken.
It's the \[E&]same old theme since \[C]1916,
in your \[G]head, in your head, they're still f\[D/F#]ighting
With their \[E&]tanks and their bombs and their \[C]bombs and their guns,
In your \[G]head, in your head, they're d\[D/F#]ying.
